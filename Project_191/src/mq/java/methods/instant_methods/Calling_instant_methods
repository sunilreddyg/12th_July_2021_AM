=> In order to call instant methods[which one don't have static keyword]
	we should create object for class.
	
	
	Object Creation Syntax:-->
	
			ClassName obj=new ClassName();
			obj.methodname();
			obj.varaiblename();
			
			
			Note:-->No need to call constructor repeatedly for
					individual method to all. Constructor can be
					stored into reference and we can call all
					methods and variables with help of reference only
			
			
			
		=>Calling method without variable reference
			
			
			new Classname().methodname();
			new Classname().variablename();
			
			
			Note:--> When user need to call single method or variable
					 we can call instantly without create reference
