Method Overriding:-->

Declaring a method in sub class which is already present in 
parent class is known as method overriding. 

Overriding is done so that a child class can give its own implementation 
to a method which is already provided by the parent class. 


In this case the method in parent class is called overridden method and the
 method in child class is called overriding method
